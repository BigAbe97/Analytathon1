Here's a project plan for this task:

	1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The first step is to understand the dataset and explore it. This includes identifying the variables, their types, and their distributions. We also need to check for missing values and outliers, and clean the data if necessary. Some possible R packages for EDA include dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, and data.table.

	2. Feature Engineering: Once we have a good understanding of the dataset, we can engineer some features that may be useful for our analysis. For example, we could calculate the average daily energy consumption of each customer, or the variance of their energy usage over time. Some useful R packages for feature engineering include zoo and lubridate.

	3. Clustering: Next, we can use clustering techniques to identify groups of customers that have similar energy usage patterns. One popular clustering algorithm is K-means, but other algorithms like hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN may also be useful. We can use R packages like cluster, factoextra, and dbscan for clustering.

	4. Classification: Once we have identified clusters of customers with similar energy usage patterns, we can train a classification model to predict whether a new customer is likely to be an EV customer based on their energy usage pattern. We can use R packages like caret, mlr, and randomForest for classification.

	5. Validation and Evaluation: Finally, we need to validate and evaluate our model to ensure that it is accurate and reliable. This includes testing the model on a holdout dataset to see how well it performs on new data, and using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate its performance.
